# Build-My-Own-Blockchain

I do not understand blockchain, so i create [one](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x).

This project basically for education and self-entertainment only, some trivial mechanisms of blockchain have not been implemented, including account system, complete distributed network communicating system and so on.

## How to use

Basically, run the following command works good enough.
```
python main.py
```
## Argument

The program provide some options to customize some behavior and environment.

Argument ```-u``` indicates showing the user interface built by [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) or not. Default in command mode which is not popping the UI.

Argument ```-i``` and ```-p``` decided which ip-address and port the program listen and connect to. Default value is ```127.0.0.1``` and ```9527```. 

And of course, argument ```-h``` to get more information about all argument of executing the program.
