# Build-My-Own-Blockchain

I do not understand blockchain, so i create [one](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x).

This project basically for education and self-entertainment only, some trivial mechanisms of blockchain have not been implemented, including account system, complete distributed network communicating system and so on.

## How to use

Basically, run the following command works good enough.
```
python main.py
```
Furthermore, `rgument ``-h``` to get more information.
